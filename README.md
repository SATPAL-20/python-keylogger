Keyloggers can be used for various purposes, both legitimate and malicious. Legitimate uses include monitoring computer activity for security and parental control purposes. For example, employers may use keyloggers to track employees' computer usage or parents may use them to monitor their children's online activities.

However, keyloggers can also be used for malicious purposes, such as stealing personal information, login credentials, or financial data. Malicious keyloggers are often associated with malware or spyware and are used by attackers to compromise the security and privacy of individuals or organizations.
